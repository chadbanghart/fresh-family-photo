        Our Platform offers services for both Job Posters and Photographers! As
        a Job Poster, you will be able to create a job entry that then becomes
        available for the photographers to apply to on our Job Board. You will
        have the ability to edit and view any applicant to your job posting
        within your Jobs page. As a Photographer, you can apply to any job you
        are available for! You have the ability to set your profile up with
        details to help inform the Job Posters about yourself, while also being
        able to attach your resume when you fill out your application. You also
        have the option of writing a pitch about why you are a good fit!
        Navigate to our Log In page to get started!
